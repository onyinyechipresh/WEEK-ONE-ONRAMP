**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Where to find everything
The designs are in in the `/design' folder which contains a fig file that can be viewed using figma and contains information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.


You will find all the required assets(images and icons) in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

Get colors, fonts etc from the `style-guide` file or by opening the fig file in `/design/figma`

All code should be written in the `/src` folder.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


Make sure to check the wiki tab on git for the assessment workflow (a guide on how to setup git for version control on the project).

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.



Happy coding!
